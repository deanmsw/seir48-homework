# My next suggestion would be to create a simple function for a single trip on a single line. Then in that function, create a variable that will store the list/number of stops. Make sure it works in both directions on the single line. And then after do the main function and then call on your single trip function.
# get planTrip to console log the lines/stations you pass in to it back on the console
# get planTrip to log out ALL the stations for the lines you pass into it (youâ€™ll need access to all the stations so you can find YOUR stations)
# get planTrip to find the indexOf the stations you care about from the list of all the stations on your line (step 2, above)
# get planTrip to print out all the stations between your start and end station
